This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## Install

For the Angular app, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

The backend server requires Python 3.6+. Its only dependency is [Bocadillo], which can be installed using:

```bash
pip3 install starlette
pip3 install uvicorn
```
## Quick start

First, fire up the backend server:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

It will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can then start the Angular dev server using:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the result. ðŸŽŠ
